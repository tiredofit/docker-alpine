## Prerequisites and Assumptions

No prerequisites required

## Installation

### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build <arguments> (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine)

```bash
docker pull docker.io/tiredofdit/alpine:(imagetag)
```

Builds of the image are also available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-alpine/pkgs/container/docker-alpine)

```
docker pull ghcr.io/tiredofit/docker-alpine:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| Alpine version | Tag     |
| -------------- | ------- |
| `edge`         | `:edge` |
| `3.18`         | `:3.18` |
| `3.17`         | `:3.17` |
| `3.16`         | `:3.16` |

#### Multi Architecture
Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) my work so that I can work with various hardware. To see if this image supports multiple architecures, type `docker manifest (image):(tag)`


## Configuration

### Quick Start

Utilize this image as a base for further builds. Please visit the [s6 overlay repository](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for
instructions on how to enable the S6 init system when using this base or look at some of my other images
which use this as a base.

#### Scheduling Options

The image has capability of executing tasks at differnt times of the day. It follows the [cron syntax](https://cron.help/). Presently this image only supports the busybox cron however can be extended to other scheduling backends with little effort.

| Parameter                       | Description                         | Default          |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `CONTAINER_ENABLE_SCHEDULING`   | Enable Scheduled Tasks              | `TRUE`           |
| `CONTAINR_SCHEDULING_BACKEND`   | What scheduling tool to use `cron`  | `cron`           |
| `CONTAINER_SCHEDULING_LOCATION` | Where to read task files            | `/assets/cron/`  |
| `SCHEDULING_LOG_TYPE`           | Log Type `FILE`                     | `FILE`           |
| `SCHEDULING_LOG_LOCATION`       | Log File Location                   | `/var/log/cron/` |
| `SCHEDULING_LOG_LEVEL`          | Log Level `1` (loud) to `8` (quiet) | `6`              |

##### Cron Options

There are two ways to add jobs to be triggered via cron. One is to drop files into `/assets/cron/` which will be parsed upon container startup, or to set environment variables.

| Parameter | Description                                            | Default |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `CRON_*`  | Name of the job value of the time and output to be run | ``      |

Example: `CRON_HELLO="* * * * * echo 'hello' > /tmp/hello.log`

Since you can't really disable environment variables in Docker if they are baked into parent Docker images, you can override a baked in Cron command with your own values, or to disable it entirely set the value to `FALSE` eg `CRON_HELLO=FALSE`.

#### Messaging Options

If you wish to send mail, set `CONTAINER_ENABLE_MESSAGING=TRUE` and configure the following environment variables. Presently we only support one backend, but more can be added with little effort.

| Parameter                     | Description                                | Default |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `CONTAINER_ENABLE_MESSAGING`  | Enable Messaging services like SMTP        | `TRUE`  |
| `CONTAINER_MESSAGING_BACKEND` | Messaging Backend - presently only `msmtp` | `msmtp` |

##### MSMTP Options

See the [MSMTP Configuration Options](https://marlam.de/msmtp/msmtp.html) for further information on options to configure MSMTP.
| Parameter             | Description                                       | Default         | `_FILE` |

| `SMTP_USER`           | SMTP Username                                     | ``              | x       |
| `SMTP_PASS`           | SMTP Password                                     | ``              | x       |
| `SMTP_TLS`            | Use TLS                                           | `FALSE`         |         |
| `SMTP_STARTTLS`       | Start TLS from within session                     | `FALSE`         |         |

See The [Official Zabbix Agent Documentation](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/5.4/manual/appendix/config/zabbix_agentd)
for information about the following Zabbix values.

#### Monitoring Options
This image includes the capability of using agents inside the image to monitor metrics from applications. Presently at this time it only supports Zabbix as a monitoring platform, however is extendable to other platforms with little effort.

| Parameter                     | Description                                  | Default  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `CONTAINER_ENABLE_MONITORING` | Enable Monitoring of applications or metrics | `TRUE`   |
| `CONTAINR_MONITORING_BACKEND` | What monitoring agent to use `zabbix`        | `zabbix` |

##### Zabbix Options

This image comes with Zabbix Agent 1 (Classic or C compiled) and Zabbix Agent 2 (Modern, or Go compiled). See which variables work for each version and make your agent choice. Drop files in `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf.d` to setup your metrics. The environment variables below only affect the system end of the configuration. If you wish to use your own system configuration without these variables, change `ZABBIX_SETUP_TYPE` to `MANUAL`

| Parameter                            | Description                                                                                   | Default                  | 1   | 2   | `_FILE` |

This image supports autoregistering configuration as an Active Agent to a Zabbix Proxy or a Server. It looks in `/etc/zabbix_agent.conf.d/*.conf` for the string `# Autoregister=` and takes these values and adds it to the `HostMetadata` configuration entry automatically wrapped around `:` eg `:application:` . Use it by creating an Auto register rule and search for that string. You can find server templates in this repository in the `[zabbix_templates](zabbix_templates/)` directory.

#### Logging Options

This is work in progress for a larger logging solution. Presently there is functionality to rotate logs on a daily basis, however as this section matures there will be the capability to also ship the logs to an external data warehouse like Loki, or Elastic Search. At present Log shipping is only supported by `fluent-bit` and x86_64 only.

| Parameter                                | Description                                                 | Default      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `CONTAINER_ENABLE_LOGROTATE`             | Enable Logrotate (if scheduling enabled)                    | `TRUE`       |
| `CONTAINER_ENABLE_LOGSHIPPING`           | Enable Log Shipping                                         | `FALSE`      |
| `CONTAINER_LOGSHIPPING_BACKEND`          | Log shipping backend `fluent-bit`                           | `fluent-bit` |
| `LOGROTATE_COMPRESSION_TYPE`             | Logfile compression algorithm `NONE` `BZIP2` `GZIP` `ZSTD`  | `ZSTD`       |
| `LOGROTATE_COMPRESSION_VALUE`            | What level of compression to use                            | `8`          |
| `LOGROTATE_COMPRESSION_EXTRA_PARAMETERS` | Pass extra parameters to the compression command (optional) |              |
| `LOGROTATE_RETAIN_DAYS`                  | Rotate and retain logs for x days                           | `7`          |

##### Log Shipping Parsing

You can set an environment variable to start shipping a log without any other configuration. Create a variable starting with `LOGSHIP_<name>` with the value of the location of the log files. You can also use this to null an existing configuration by setting the value of `FALSE`.

Example: `LOGSHIP_NGINX=/var/log/nginx/*.log` will create and tag all log files from that directory as to be coming from `CONTAINER_NAME` and from `nginx`. Note, it does not allow for custom parsing, so will simply parse the log entry as is.

If `LOGSHIPPING_AUTO_CONFIG_LOGROTATE` set to true, you can define what parser the configuration file should use. Make sure you have the appropriate `.conf` parsers in `/etc/fluent-bit/parsers.d/`
Create a line in the `logrotate.d/<file>` that looks like `# logship: <parser>`. Multiple parsers can be added by seperating via commas. Alternatively, if you wanted to skip a certain logfile from being parsed by the log shipper, use the value "SKIP".

| Parameter                           | Description                                                                          | Default |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `LOGSHIPPING_AUTO_CONFIG_LOGROTATE` | Automatically configure log shipping for files that are listed in `/etc/logrotate.d` | `TRUE`  |


##### Fluent-Bit Options

Drop files in `/etc/fluent-bit/conf.d` to setup your inputs and outputs. The environment variables below only affect the system end of the configuration. If you wish to use your own system configuration without these variables, change `FLUENTBIT_SETUP_TYPE` to `MANUAL`. Container will attempt to automatically create configuration to send to a destination, or can also be set to act as a receiver from other fluent-bit hosts and forward data to a remote log analysis service.

#### Firewall Options|

Included when proper capabilities are set on image is the capability to set up detailed block / allow rules via a firewall on container start. Presently only `iptables` is supported.
You must use run your containers with the following capabilities added: `NET_ADMIN`, `NET_RAW`

| Parameter                    | Description                             | Default    |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `CONTAINER_ENABLE_FIREWALL`  | Enable Firewall Functionality           | `FALSE`    |
| `CONTAINER_FIREWALL_BACKEND` | What Firewall backend to use `iptables` | `iptables` |
| `FIREWALL_RULE_00`           | Firewall rule to execute                |            |
| `FIREWALL_RULE_01`           | Next firewall rule to execute           |            |

One can use the `FIREWALL_RULE_XX` environment variables to pass rules to the firewall. In this example I am going to block someone from being able to access a port except if from a specific IP address:

````bash
FIREWALL_RULE_00=-I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -s 101.69.69.101 --dport 389 -j ACCEPT
FIREWALL_RULE_01=-I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 --dport 389 -j DROP
````

##### IPTables Options

Instead of relying on environment variables one can put a `iptables-restore` compatible ruleset below and it will be imported on container start.

| Parameter             | Description                                                 | Default             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `IPTABLES_RULES_PATH` | Path for IPTables Rules                                     | `/assets/iptables/` |
| `IPTABLES_RULES_FILE` | IPTables Rules File to restore if exists on container start | `iptables.rules`    |


##### Fail2Ban Options

The container also has the capability should `CONTAINER_ENABLE_FIREWALL=TRUE` be enabled to launch Fail2ban, a process which watches logs for patterns and then blocks the remote host from connecting for a period of time.
Drop your custom jail configs as *.conf files in `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/` and filters in `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d` for them to be parsed at startup.  Note the startup delay environment variable to avoid the process failing if no log files exist from a fresh install.

#### Permissions

If you wish to change the internal id for users and groups you can set environment variables to do so.
e.g. If you add `USER_NGINX=1000` it will reset the containers `nginx` user id from `82` to `1000` -

If you enable `DEBUG_PERMISSIONS=TRUE` all the users and groups have been modified in accordance with
environment variables will be displayed in output.

Hint, also change the Group ID to your local development users UID & GID and avoid Docker permission issues when developing.

| Parameter                         | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `CONTAINER_GROUP_<GROUPNAME>`     | The group's GID in /etc/group and /etc/passwd will be modified with new GID |
| `CONTAINER_GROUP_ADD_<GROUPNAME>` | The username will be added in /etc/group after the group name defined       |

#### Process Watchdog

This is experimental functionality to call an external script before a process is executed.

Sample use cases:

- Alert slack channel when process has executed more than once
- Disable process from executing further if restarted 50 times
- Write to an additional log file..
- Change a file to display "Under Maintenance" on a webserver if this process isn't supposed to be run more than 1 time.


It will pass 5 arguments to a bash script titled the same name as the executing script or if not found, use the default `CONTAINER_PROCESS_HELPER_SCRIPT` below. Drop your files into the `CONTAINER_PROCESS_HELPER_PATH`.

For example, if `04-scheduling` was starting, it would look for `$CONTAINER_PROCESS_HELPER_PATH/04-scheduling` and if found execute it while passing the following arguments: DATE,TIME,SCRIPT_NAME,TIMES EXECUTED,HOSTNAME

e.g: `2021-07-01 23:01:04 04-scheduling 2 container`

Use the values in your own bash script using the `$1` `$2` `$3` `$4` `$5` syntax.
Change time and date and settings with these environment variables

## Developing / Overriding

This base image has been used over a hundred times to successfully build secondary images. My methodology is admittedly straying from the "one process per container" rule, however this methodology allows me to put together images at a rapid pace, and if more complex scalability is required, the work is split into their own individual images. Since you are reading this here's a crash course at how the image works: (WIP):

See `/assets/functions/00-container` for more detailed documentation for the various commands and functions/shortcuts

- Put defaults in `/assets/defaults/(script name)`
- Put functions in `/assets/functions/(script name)`
- Put Initialization script in `/etc/cont-init.d/(script name)`

  Put at the top:

````bash
#!/command/with-contenv bash          # Pull in Container Environment Variables from Dockerfile/Docker Runtime
source /assets/functions/00-container # Pull in all custom container functions from this image
prepare_service single                # Read functions and defaults only from files matching this script filename - see detailed docs for more
PROCESS_NAME="process"                # set the prefix for any logging

.. your scripting ..
print_info "This an INFO log"
print_warn "This a WARN log"
print_error "This is a ERROR log"

liftoff                               # this writes to the state files at /tmp/.container/ to prove the script executed properly see CONTAINER_SKIP_SANITY_CHECK
````

- Put Services script in `/etc/services.available/(script name)`

  Put at the top:

````bash
#!/command/with-contenv bash          # Pull in Container Environment Variables from Dockerfile/Docker Runtime
source /assets/functions/00-container # Pull in all custom container functions from this image
prepare_service defaults single       # Read defaults only from files matching this script filename - see detailed docs for more
PROCESS_NAME="process"                # set the prefix for any logging

check_container_initialized           # Check to make sure that the container properly initialized before proceeding
check_service_initialized init        # Check to see if the cont-init.d/scriptname executed correctly, otherwise wait until it has done
liftoff                               # Prove script was able to execute properly

print_start "Starting processname"    # Show STARTING log prefix, and also show if enabled a counter, and execute process watchdog script
fakeprocess (args)                    # whatever your process you want to start is
````

## Debug Mode

When using this as a base image, create statements in your startup scripts to check for existence of `DEBUG_MODE=TRUE`
and set various parameters in your applications to output more detail, enable debugging modes, and so on.
In this base image it does the following:

* Sets zabbix-agent to output logs in verbosity
* Shows all script output (equivalent to set -x)

## Maintenance

### Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell.

``bash
docker exec -it (whatever your container name is) bash
